He kept cold water in the car, helped us in Jaipur markets, and took us to a quiet rooftop cafe facing the Taj. The sunrise boat ride in Varanasi was the highlight of our trip!`,

Koikoi travel listened to what we actually wanted (less temples, more nature and calm backwaters) and built a custom plan. The private houseboat in Alleppey with just the two of us was unforgettable!`,
